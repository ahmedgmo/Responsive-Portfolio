            <h2>About me</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="Ahmed's Picture" title="Ahmed Osman">
            <p>I am an aspiring Fullstack Developer with a background in Human Resources and Business Administration. My history with technology goes back to a time when floppy disks were the thing. As a child, I used to build, and erm… destroy, my own desktops. I didn’t shy away from trying a new component, or a new trick to overclock my CPU to the limit. My passion now is in web and application development as a new career path to put my passion and my career together. I worked as Recruitment Consultant for over eight years. Throughout my career, I supported large international organizations in Canada and abroad. In my free time, you will find me riding my motorcycle, playing soccer or trying a new restaurant in Toronto…. That’s in the summer though. In the winter, I will be doing the same things, but driving.</p>
            <p>Please feel free to browse around my portfolio. There is nothing in it yet, except for a few pictures I didn't even take. It is a matter of time, though, before the portfolio page becomes busy. Also don't forget to drop me a not to say that you were here. I may not get your message though as the submit button doesn't work yet (no JavaScript). As I said, it is just a matter of time.</p>
